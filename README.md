# Dynamic Sum
Hello guys,
     This question I got in interview but on that time I was not able do it. Five Months later, finally I did it.
     The coding is not good yet! I admit, but It good to code at least because five months ago, even I was not able to think the logic.
<!--      If you guys have better code than please share and improve my knowledge. -->
Thanks.
